* PistonMiner and **Zephiles** for their work on TTYD symbol maps, and the GCI loader code (GitHub repo for the loader [here](https://github.com/Zephiles/TTYD-Randomizers).)

### Overview
The Paper Mario: TTYD **Shufflizer** is a mod that introduces the following random elements based on a seed determined by the save file name:
* Replaces all one-time field item pickups and Charlieton / Pianta / badge shop items with a random permutation of a fixed pool of items.
* Randomizes all item shops such that they contain each normal item once, plus a selection of random recipes and badges.
* (Optionally) shuffles the order of enemy encounters in the Pit of 100 Trials, and balances their stats according to their placement within the Pit.

In addition, the player can pull up a menu to globally adjust enemies' HP, ATK, and DEF power, and toggle on/off Pit floor randomization (hold Z and use the D-Pad to make / adjust menu selections, and hold Z + press L to toggle on/off options).

**The Shufflizer currently only supports the North American NTSC version of TTYD.**
